<B>Portar Doc Version 1.7, last updated 21st March 2001 by Martin Korth.<BR>
</B>This document describes the I/O Map of MSX computers, attempting to 
supply a very compact and mostly complete document about MSX1 and MSX2 
hardware. It does not include information about the MSX firmware and 
operating systems, such like BIOS, BASIC, BDOS, MSXDOS, or CP/M related 
functions. Written by MAYER (1991-1995) and Martin Korth (1999-2001).<BR>

<B>Memory Map example for a diskless MSX1 machine<BR>
</B>A typical MSX1 model includes 32K ROM, and 8K, 16K, 32K, or 64K RAM. 
External RAM or ROM Expansions/Games, or Disk Controller (with 16K DISK 
ROM) could be connected to either of the two cartridge slots.<BR>
<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
(*) If less than 64K internal RAM is installed, then RAM is located in 
the higher memory area only, ie. at address E000-FFFF for 8K, C000-FFFF 
for 16K, etc.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Memory Map example for a MSX2 machine with built-in Disk Drive<BR>
</B>A typical MSX2 model includes 48K ROM (called BIOS, BASIC, and SUB), and 
in this example, 16K ROM for the DISK Drive. Typically 128K, 256K, or 
512K RAM are built-in.<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
Because of the additional internal ROM, Slot 3 is sub-classed into 4 
slots by using a new Secondary Slot Register (Memory FFFFh, see below). 
The RAM is split into 16K banks, four of these banks can be mapped into 
memory at once by using a Memory Mapper (Port FCh-FFh, see below).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Port 0A8h, Primary Slot Register (PSLOT, PPI Port A) (Read/Write)<BR>
</B>Used to select internal RAM, or ROM, or external memory (cartridges) 
into CPU address space, as shown in the examples above. In some cases 
also used to select 'memory mapped I/O ports' into memory.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit   Expl.
  0-1   PSLOT number 0-3 for memory at 0000-3FFF
  2-3   PSLOT number 0-3 for memory at 4000-7FFF
  4-5   PSLOT number 0-3 for memory at 8000-BFFF
  6-7   PSLOT number 0-3 for memory at C000-FFFF
</TD></TR></TABLE>The PSLOT register is available in all MSX models, and Slot 0 is always 
used for Main ROM. However, there is no standard for the assignment of 
Slot 1-3. For example, RAM might be located in Slot 1, or Slot 2, or 
Slot 3.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Memory PSLOT:FFFFh, Secondary Slot Register (SSLOT) (Read Inverted, Write)<BR>
</B>Used to subclass a Primary Slot into four Secondary Slots. Before 
accessing a secondary slot register its primary slot must be selected 
into memory at C000-FFFF (done by Bit 6-7 of Port A8h). The new SSLOT 
value may then be written to memory address FFFFh, reading from that 
address returns the current SSLOT value XORed by FFh (this behaviour 
might be used to detect the presence of a secondary slot).<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit   Expl.
  0-1   SSLOT number 0-3 for memory at 0000-3FFF of respective PSLOT
  2-3   SSLOT number 0-3 for memory at 4000-7FFF of respective PSLOT
  4-5   SSLOT number 0-3 for memory at 8000-BFFF of respective PSLOT
  6-7   SSLOT number 0-3 for memory at C000-FFFF of respective PSLOT
</TD></TR></TABLE>Theoretically each PSLOT could be subclassed by separate SSLOT 
registers. Commonly only one of the PSLOTs is subclassed though, and 
older computers with not more than 32K ROM do not contain any SSLOT 
registers at all. Beside for the internal usuage, SSLOTs might be found 
in Slot Expansion Cartridges which would then allow to connect up to 
four cartridges to a single cartride slot. As for PSLOTs, there is no 
standard that defines which PSLOT should contain an SSLOTs, and which of 
the SSLOTs should contain RAM...<BR>
<BR>
<B>Memory Mapper (RAM Banking)<BR>
</B>A memory mapper is usually available in MSX computers with more than 64K 
internal RAM. The BIOS initializes these banks in reversed order, ie. 
the default values for Port FC-FF are 03-00.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Port FC   RAM bank number to be mapped at 0000-3FFF
  Port FD   RAM bank number to be mapped at 4000-7FFF
  Port FE   RAM bank number to be mapped at 8000-BFFF
  Port FF   RAM bank number to be mapped at C000-FFFF
</TD></TR></TABLE>Usually the mapping circuit latches only the actually used lower 3, 4, 
or 5 bits of the bank numbers, depending on whether 128K, 256K, or 512K 
RAM are built-in. Theoretically (fully exanped) a total of 4MByte RAM 
(16Kbyte * 256 blocks) could be controlled by the mapping registers.<BR>
To enable/disable RAM, use the PSLOT register (Port A8h), and (if any) 
the SSLOT register (Address FFFFh).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Memory Mapped I/O<BR>
</B>Beside for RAM and ROM some of the addresses of some slots might be also 
used as memory mapped I/O Ports. (For example for Disk Controllers, and 
Cartridge Memory Mappers, and the Secondary Slot register.)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cartridge Memory Mappers<BR>
</B>Cartridges with more than 64K ROM or RAM must include their own memory 
mappers (cartridges with 64K ROM often include a mapper also, even 
though it isn't actually required). Various different mappers exist, 
read the chapter about Cartridge Memory Mappers for more information 
about the must commonly used chips.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Further Memory<BR>
</B>Video Memory is not part of the memory map because VRAM can be accessed 
through I/O ports only (as described in the chapter about the Video 
Display Processor). Some computers may also include japanese character 
set ROMs, these can be read out only through I/O ports either (as 
described in the chapter about Kanji ROM).<BR>

<BR>
<B>Port 0ABh, PPI Control Register (Write Only)<BR>
</B>This port is used in two ways depending on bit 7. If bit7 is zero, then 
this port can be used to set or reset a single bit in PPI register C. 
This is just an alternate method to modify bits in register C than by 
writing to it directly (via Port AAh).<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>Otherwise, if bit7 is set, then this port is used as Mode Setup for PPI 
Port A-C. Theoretically these registers can be used as input or output 
ports. However, in the MSX, PPI Port A and C are always used as output, 
and PPI Port B as input. The BIOS initializes it like that by writing 
82h to Port ABh on startup. Afterwards it makes no sense to change this 
setting, and thus needs no further explanatation here.<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>Line 9 and 10 are used/reserved for numeric keypad, the NUM/, NUM+, NUM* 
keys might be exchanged in some coutries. (Most MSX1 and MSX2 models do 
not include a numeric keypad at all though).<BR>
<BR>
MSX2 models have been delivered with country-specific BIOSes and 
keymaps, in that case the logical keynames change. For example the key 
in Line 1, Bit 5 is always the key to the right of the "P"-key, but on 
german keyboards that key would be used as "UE" rather than "[".<BR>
<BR>
About the five function keys (F1-F5), note that the key-combinations 
Shift+F1-F5 are often referred to as F6-F10 in the MSX world. The GRAPH 
key would be the LEFT ALT key on a PC keyboard, CODE would be RIGHT ALT,

This chapter describes the standard VRAM map for the different MSX video 
modes (screens). Note that these default addresses can be changed by 
modifying VDP registers 2-6.<BR>
<BR>
The VDP Video Modes (BASIC Screen 0-8) is selected by the Bits M1-M5 of 
VDP Register 0 and 1. The relationship between the bits and the screen is:<BR>

7 of VDP register 9.<BR>
<BR>
Screen 0-3 are available on both MSX1 and MSX2, the other screens are 
supported on MSX2 only.<BR>

foreground, as in VDP register 7). The colors are assigned to the BG 
Tiles as follows: Tiles 00..07 share the first color, tiles 08..0F share 
the second color, etc, and tiles F8..FF share the last color.<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>The BG Tiles array can be placed only at address 0000h or 2000h, ie. 
only bit 2 of VDP Register 4 is used. The BG Colors array is placed at 
the same address XORed by 2000h (ie. either at 2000h or 0000h).<BR>
<BR>
In screen 2, the BG Tile memory consists of 300h tiles. The screen is 
vertically divided into 3 sections, all BG Map entries for the upper 8 
character rows refer to tiles 00..FFh, the middle 8 rows to tiles 
100..1FFh, and the bottom 8 rows to tiles 200..2FFh.<BR>
<BR>
As usually, all TILE-BYTES define rows of eight pixels, each of these 
rows is colorized by a separate COLOR-BYTE in the BG Colors array, 
whereas each COLOR-BYTE defines the background color in bit 0-3 (for "0" 
bits in TILE-BYTE) and the foreground color in bit 4-7 (for "1" bits). 
That means there can be only 2 different colors in each row of 8 pixels!<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>The screen consists of 32x24 background tiles, each tile consists of 4 
blocks, whereas each of these "pixels" can be colorized in any of the 
available 16 colors.<BR>
<BR>
The BG Tile memory is organized as follows: It contains 8 color bytes 
for each of the 100h tiles. But obviously only two bytes are actually 
required (first byte for the upper half, and second byte for the lower 
half, in both cases most significant bits for the left 'pixels').<BR>
<BR>
Which of the 8 bytes are used depends on the lower two bits of the 
vertical position (0-23), ie. tiles in lines 0,4,8,12,etc. use the first 
two bytes, tiles in lines 1,5,9,etc. use the next two bytes, and so on.<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>No$hackwork: (Even/Odd VRAM addressing)<BR>
In screen 7 and 8 (the video modes with 256 bytes per line), the video 
RAM is addressed differently as usually.<BR>
<BR>
In these modes, the first 64K VRAM are used for even addresses, and the 
second 64K for ODD addresses. Ie. the address lines aren't A16..A0, 
rather it is A15..A0,A16. That method allows the video controller to 
increment the lower address lines at the same clock rate as in 128 
byte/line modes.<BR>
<BR>
The funny thing about that is, that it isn't visible for the programmer, 
ie. to set the 6th dot in first line in screen 8, (or the 12th and 13th, 
in screen 7), the program would still have to write to the (virtual) 
address 00005h, as if there would be no special even/odd feature. But 
physically the byte would be written to address 10002h!<BR>
<BR>
As noted above, that is all done behind your back, and you don't have to 
care about it at all - EXCEPT if you write data into VRAM before you set 
up the desired video mode, ie. if you switch to screen 7/8 (or back), 
then any data that is already in VRAM changes it's position! Virtually 
at least...<BR>

define the colors as follows:<BR>

  Bit 2-4   Red, 0-7

</TD></TR></TABLE>(Addresses in pharentheses is used in 26.5 lines mode. Observe that they 
are overlapping).<BR>
The Characters attribute table is an array of bits, ie. the first byte 
of the table contains bits for the first 8 characters on the screen.<BR>
<BR>
If the attribute-bit is zero, then the character is displayed as usually 
(colored as defined in VDP Reg 07h). If the bit is set, then the 
character is blinking (see VDP Reg 0Ch, and VDP Reg 0Dh).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="foregroundsprites"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;Foreground Sprites</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>OBJ Attributes (Sprite attribute):<BR>
</B>Defines 'OAM' data for up to 32 foreground sprites. Each entry consists 
of four bytes:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  0: Y-pos, Vertical position (FFh is topmost, 00h is second line, etc.)
  1: X-pos, Horizontal position (00h is leftmost)
  2: Pattern number
  3: Attributes. b0-3:Color, b4-6:unused, b7:EC (Early Clock)
</TD></TR></TABLE>If EC is set to 1, the X-pos is subtracted by 32 (can be used to place 
sprites particulary offscreen to the left.<BR>
<BR>
When using 16x16 pixel sprites the lower two bits of the sprite number 
are ignored (should be zero). A 16x16 sprite logically consists of four 
8x8 sprites, whereas the first 8x8 sprite is displayed in upperleft, the 
second one in lower left, the third in upper right, and the fourth in 
lower right.<BR>
<BR>
If Y-pos is set to 208 (D0h), the sprite AND ALL FOLLOWING sprites are 
hidden! For MSX2 video modes (Screen 4-8), the same happens if Y-pos is 
set to 216 (D8h).<BR>
<BR>
If the display is scrolled via VDP register 17h, this also affects the 
positions of the sprites! Ie. the actual visible position of the sprite 
would be YLOC+1-VDP(17h).<BR>
However, the special hide-the-sprites-value (YLOC=216) is hardcoded, 
independendly of the screen offset in VDP register 17h! If a sprite 
should be displayed in that line, either 215 or 217 must be used 
instead!<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sprite colours<BR>
</B>In MSX2 video modes with colored sprites (screen 4-8), the fourth byte 
of the OAM entires is unused. Instead, the sprite attributes are stored 
in a separate 'color table'.<BR>
That table is always placed at the address of the above sprite attribute 
table minus 200h. The color table contains 20h entries (one for each 
entry of the OAM table), and each entry is sized 10h bytes.<BR>
The 10h bytes of each entry specify color & attributes for each line of 
the displayed sprites (assuming that the sprite size is set to 16x16).<BR>
<BR>
The bytes in that color table are used as follow:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit 0-3    CL  Color Code (0-15)
  Bit 4      0   Unused
  Bit 5      IC  Ignore collisions with other sprites. (1=Ignore)
  Bit 6      CC  Mix color with sprite that has next higher priority.
  Bit 7      EC  Early clock (shift this line of the sprite 32 pixels to left)
</TD></TR></TABLE>For screen 4-7 the color code specifies the desired palette color, for 
screen 8 the sprite colors are hardcoded as follows:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Bit 0      Blue      (1=on, 0=off)
  Bit 1      Red       (1=on, 0=off)
  Bit 2      Green     (1=on, 0=off)
  Bit 3      Intensity (1=Light, 0=dark)
</TD></TR></TABLE>If the intensity-bit is set alone (with b0-2 cleared, ie. color 8), then 
something like bright pink or bright orange is displayed instead.<BR>
<BR>
When CC is set, the color of the sprite is logically ORed with the 
pixels of the sprite "that has the next higher priority, and that has 
CC=0". In that case a collision just mixes colors, and does not causes a 
conflict, ie. bit 5 of status register 0 doesn't get set.<BR>
<BR>
If a line of a sprite has the CC bit set, then it MUST collide with at 
least one pixel of another sprite with higher priority, otherwise the 
line of the sprite isn't displayed at all!<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>This 14bit Pointer value allows to address 16Kbytes of VRAM (ie. the

pointer becomes incremented &lt;before&gt; data is actually read from Port 
98h. If so, note that the latched byte might contain old data if the

</B>On MSX2 the upper bits of the above 14bit pointer can be specified in 
VDP Register 0Eh, allowing to address the total of 128K VRAM. This 
register becomes automatically incremented when the 14bit read/write 
pointer overflows, for MSX1 compatibility this happens only in MSX2 
video modes though. Additional 64K VRAM (if any) can be addressed by 
setting MXC bit of VDP Register 2Dh.<BR>

Bit 0-4 indicate the number of the sprite that wasn't displayed 
properly. If more than one sprite haven't displayed properly, then Bit 
0-4 specify the first of these bad sprites.<BR>
<BR>
A sprite is overlapping another if a non-transparent pixel of a sprite 
hits a non-transparent pixel of another sprite. Whereas in MSX2 colored 
sprite modes this verfication can be made optional for specific sprites 
by CC and IC bits in the sprite OAM data.<BR>
<BR>
The IRQ flag in bit 7 gets set at the beginning of the VBlank period, if 
IE0 in VDP Register 1 is set (or gets set at a later time, while the IRQ 
flag is still set) then an interrupt is generated.<BR>
<BR>
The IRQ flag (bit 7) and the collision flag (bit 5) get cleared after 
reading Status register 0.<BR>
BUG: When reading this register at the same time when IRQ changes from 0 
to 1, this sometimes results in old value to be read (IRQ=0) before it 
becomes changed to 1, but the read-signal still acknowledges the IRQ 
(and sets it back to IRQ=0) - in that case the IRQ is lost.<BR>

<B>Port 9Bh, VDP Register Data (Raw Data, Write only)<BR>
</B>This register offers an alternate method to access the VDP registers on 
MSX2 computers. (Normally VDP registers are set by writing TWO bytes 
(data, index) to Port 99h as described above).<BR>
<BR>
Writing to port 9Bh directly sets the VDP register that is addressed by 
VDP Register 11h. Afterwards (if the auto increment bit was set) the 
value in register 11h gets incremented automatically. (See VDP register 
11h description for more details).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Example for Port 9Bh: Initializing VDP registers 00h..17h<BR>
</B>Write 00h (index 00h, increment=on) to VDP register 11h (using the 
oldstyle method through port 99h). Now write 18h bytes of data for 
registers 00h..17h to 9Bh (The data written to Register 11h is ignored, 
so that it can't damage itself).<BR>

leftmost pixel(s) will be undefined, to avoid this dirt effect, the MSK 
bit must be set, the leftmost 8 pixels (16 pixels in Screen 6-7) will be 
then covered by the border color.<BR>
<BR>
<B>YJK=0 (YAE=Ignored) - Normal RGB Mode<BR>
</B>When YJK is set to zero, colors are generated identically as on MSX2. 
Ie. Screen 0-7 Background and Sprites are colorized by the 3/3/3 bit RGB 
values that are defined in the Palette Registers. Screen 8 background is 
using hardcoded 3/3/2 bit RGB values for background, and hardcoded 
(1/1/1)*2 bit colors for sprites.<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>Note: Even though up to 131072 colors could be selected by YJK codes, 
the resulting RGB values are cut down to 5 bits each, so that not more 
than 32768 colors can be displayed in practice.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WTE - Bit 2 - Wait Function Enable<BR>
</B>When WTE is cleared, access to VRAM works in the same way as V9938, ie. 
the programmer must take care about inserting delays between each VRAM 
access.<BR>
The WAIT function is enabled when WTE is set. When the CPU accesses the 
VRAM, any following CPU access to any V9958 ports is offhold by a WAIT 
signal until the VRAM access is completed. (This feature is supposed to 
speed up the writing time of data from CPU to VRAM.)<BR>
However, WAIT function is provided after VRAM access only, not after 
access to any VDP registers, any VDP status registers, or VDP palette 
registers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>VDS - Bit 5 - Output selection between CPUCLK and /VDS<BR>
</B>Unlike V9938, the V9958 video chip doesn't have two separate pins for 
CPUCLK and /VDS signals, instead a single pin is shared for both 
signals. By default CPUCLK is output, alternately, /VDS can be output by 
setting the VDS bit. (Using /VDS mode in MSX offers no known advantages, 
but it is reported to confuse some TV tuners and thus shouldn't be 
used.)<BR>
<BR>
<B>CMD - Bit 6 - Command Function<BR>
</B>Normally MSX2 Video Commands (VDP Registers 20h-2Eh) can be used in 
Screen 5-8 only. However, by setting the CMD bit Video Commands may be 
used in all other Screen modes. In these 'additional' modes, Video 
Commands are accessing VRAM bytewise (as in Screen 8), therefore X/Y 
coordinates as in Screen 8 must be used. (The CMD bit has no influence 
in Screen 5-8.)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Deleted Functions<BR>
</B>The V9958 does not output a Composite Video Signal, and does not include 
a Mouse/Lightpen Interface. In the result, the following bits have been 
removed (and should be set to zero): Bit 5 of VDP Reg 00h (IE2), Bit 6 
and 7 of VDP Reg 08h (LP and MS), Bit 6 and 7 of VDP Status Reg 01h (LPS 
and FL).<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>For high speed commands, all bits are used, ie. in screen 5-7 more than 
one pixel can be transferred at once. For all other commands, only one 
pixel can be specified at once, so in screen 5-7 only the lower 2 or 4 
bits of the register are used.<BR>
<BR>
For VDP -&gt; VRAM commands, all pixel(s) are colorized in the same color,<BR>
which must have been written to this register before the command 
started.<BR>
<BR>
For CPU -&gt; VRAM commands, each pixel (or byte in highspeed mode) must be 
written to this register separately, whereas the first pixel (or byte) 
should be written &lt;before&gt; the command gets started! When the command 
has been started, bit 7 of VDP status register 2 indicates whether the 
VDP controller is ready to receive the next value, and bit 0 indicates 
if the command has been completed.<BR>

<B>Notes about above 'VDP' and 'CPU' Expressions<BR>
</B>'CPU' in the above table means that the commands expects more than one 
value to be read/written manually by the program. And 'VDP' means that 
only one value is expected to be read/written by the program. In both 
cases, data is written through VDP Register 2Ch, or read through status 
register 07h.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Notes about X-Loc and X-Len<BR>
</B>Highspeed commands always copy whole bytes, so in screen 6-7 the lower 
bit(s) of the X-Loc and X-Len operands have no effect.<BR>
For the Fill and Copy Commands, a horizontal length of zero is treated 
as maximum length (that is distance from origin to screen border).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Vertical Copy Command<BR>
</B>For the 'Vertical' Copy command, the source X-Loc operand is ignored 
(the destination X-Loc operand is used for both source and destination). 
Also, the X-Len operand is ignored (Instead distance from origin to end 
of screen is used as horizontal length). Otherwise the command is quite 
the same as the Copy Rectangle command, probably a good bit faster 
though.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Notes about Line Command<BR>
</B>For the 'Line' command, the greater value of the X-Len and Y-Len 
operands must be always placed into Register 28h and 29h (Major Length) 
and the smaller value must be placed into Register 2Ah and 2Bh (Minor 
Length).<BR>
For 'vertical' lines, bit 0 of VDP Register 2Dh must be set to indicate 
that Register 28h and 29h refer to the Y-Len.<BR>
Also note that the length values for the Line command specify the 
relocation from the origin, so a length of 0;0 would draw a single dot. 
The function allows to draw diagonal lines at any angle.<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="vdpinterrupts"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;VDP Interrupts</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Interrupt Sources<BR>
</B>The MSX2 includes two interrupt sources: VBlank and HBlank interrupts. 
For MSX1 only the VBlank interrupt source exist.<BR>
A VBlank interrupt is requested each time when the VDP begins to draw 
the lower screen border (ie. in scanline 192 or 212, depending on the 
vertical screen resolution).<BR>
A HBlank interrupt is requested when the VDP draws the scanline 
specified in VDP register 13h, this might be any of the 192 or 212 
scanlines of the picture - or one of the following scanlines in the 
lower screen border section. Multiple HBlank Interrupts can be generated 
by re-writing VDP Register 13h several times per frame.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupt Enable Flags<BR>
</B>VBlank and HBlank interrupts can be separately enabled/disabled by bits 
in VDP Registers 0 and 1. In case that the Z80 has disabled interrupts 
by clearing the IFF flag (for example by a "DI" instruction) then this 
becomes priority and VDP interrupt enable flags are ignored even if set.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupt Requests<BR>
</B>The VDP requests interrupts by setting the Vblank or Hblank IRQ flags in 
VDP Status Register 0 and 1 each time when an interrupt condition 
becomes true. This happens even if interrupts are disabled by the IFF 
flag and/or by the VBlank interrupt enable flags, however, HBlank IRQs 
are NOT requested if the HBlank interrupt flag is cleared.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupt Execution<BR>
</B>An interrupt is executed only when all of the following conditions are 
true: The CPU must have enabled interrupts by setting IFF=1. Either the 
VBlank or HBlank interrupt must be enabled in VDP register 0 or 1, and 
the respective VBlank or HBlank IRQ flag must be set in VDP Status 
Register 0 or 1.<BR>
The interrupt handler is executed at the time when the above conditions 
become true. This might directly upon IRQ request in case that the 
enable flags were set - or directly upon enabling interrupts in case 
that an IRQ flag was set.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Acknowleding Interrupts<BR>
</B>The interrupt handler MUST manually acknowlede interrupts by reading 
from the respective VDP status register(s) which contain the IRQ 
flag(s). Otherwise the IRQ flag(s) are kept set, causing the same 
interrupt to be kept requested - which would be then executed again at 
the next time when interrupts are enabled.<BR>

Bits 4 and 5 is used by a program which uses a paddle (analog-joystick). 
A short positive edge pulse on bit 4 (or 5) starts a monostable timer 
(in the attached paddle) and the paddle sets one of the joystick bits in 
register 14 low (FIRE A (FIRE B),L,R,D or U). When the monostable times 
out, the joystick bit in port 14 is set high again. The length of the 
counting period of the monostable timer is set (in the attached paddle) 
by a variable resistor. The computer can determine the position of the 
variable resistor by measuring the time while the joystick bit in 
register 14 is low.<BR>
The Code LED is included in models that have a locking function for the 
CODE key, such like Japanese, Russian, or Korean models which are 
enabling the native character set by that key, and by some US/European 
MSX1 BIOSes. Otherwise, if the Code key is active only when held down, 
no Code LED is included.<BR>

<B>Command description<BR>
</B>Commands should only be loaded in the Command Register when the Busy 
status bit is off (Status bit 0). The one exception is the Force 
Interrupt command. Whenever a command is being executed, the Busy status 
bit is set.<BR>
At the completion of every command an INTRQ is generated. INTRQ is reset 
by either reading the status register or by loading the command register 
with a new command. In addition, INTRQ is generated if a Force Interrupt 
command condition is met.<BR>
When a command is completed, an interrupt is generated and the busy 
status bit is reset. The Status Register indicates whether the completed 
command encountered an error or was fault free.<BR>

<B>Type I commands (Restore, Seek, Step-Out, Step-In, Step)<BR>
</B>Used to move the read/write head. The stepping motor rate should be 
usally set to 6ms (r1 and r0 bits set to zero) for a 3.5-inch floppy 
disk drive. An optional verification of head position can be performed 
by setting bit 2 (V=1) in the command word.<BR>
<BR>
When V=1: When the seek is completed, the drive automatically goes into 
read mode, the track number from the first encountered Sector ID Field 
is then compared against the contents of the Track Register (or Data 
Register?), if the track numbers compare (and the ID Field CRC is 
correct) the verify operation is complete and an INTRQ is generated with 
no errors. If these track numbers do not match, the Seek Error bit of 
the status register is set.<BR>
<BR>
When V=0: When the seek is completed, the track position is not verified 
(this mode is required for unformatted disks). The command ends once the 
last step pulse is output. Since the result is that there is not enough 
time for step stability, the host system must use its software to make 
the floppy disk wait a certain period before reading or writing the 
track just arrived at.<BR>
<BR>
When the seek command is complete, the interrupt request is set and at 
the same time, the Busy bit in the status register is set to 0. When the 
CPU reads the status register, it resets the interrupt request signal.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Restore (Seek Track 0)<BR>
</B>If TR00 is not active, stepping pulses are issued until the TR00 input 
is activated. The Track Register is set to zero, and an interrupt is 
generated when track 0 has been reached.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Seek<BR>
</B>This command assumes that the Track Register contains the &lt;current&gt; 
position of the head, and that the Data Register contains the &lt;desired&gt; 
destination track number.The FD179X will update the Track Register and 
issue stepping pulses in the appropriate direction until the contents of 
the Track and Data Register are equal to each other. An interrupt is 
generated at the completion of the command.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Step-Out, Step-In, Step<BR>
</B>Issues one stepping pulse to the disk drive. Step-Out: towards track 0. 
Step-In: towards track 76. Step: same direction as for previous step 
command. The track register is updated (ie. incremented or decremented) 
only if the "T" bit has been set in the command word. An interrupt is 
generated at the end of each command.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Type II commands (Read Sector, Write Sector)<BR>
</B>Prior to loading the Type II command into the Command Register, the 
computer must load the Sector Register with the desired sector number. 
Upon receipt of the Type II command, the busy status bit is set. The 
FD179X must find an ID field with a matching Track number and Sector 
number, otherwise the Record not found status bit is set and the command 
is terminated with an interrupt.<BR>
Each of the Type II commands contains an m flag which determines if 
multiple records (sectors) are to be read or written. If m=0, a single 
sector is read or written and an interrupt is generated at the 
completion of the command. If m=1, multiple records are read or written 
with the sector register internally updated so that an address 
verification can occur on the next record. The FD179X will continue to 
read or write multiple records and update the sector register in 
numerical ascending sequence until the sector register exceeds the 
number of sectors on the track or until the Force Interrupt command is 
loaded into the Command Register.<BR>
The Type II commands for 1791-94 also contain side select compare flags. 
When C=0 (bit 1), no comparison is made. When C=1, the LSB of the side 
number is read off the ID Field of the disk and compared with the 
contents of the S flag.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Read Sector<BR>
</B>Upon receipt of the command, the head is loaded, the busy status bit set 
and when an ID field is encountered that has the correct track number, 
correct sector number, correct side number, and correct CRC, the data 
field is presented to the computer.<BR>
An DRQ is generated each time when the CPU must read a byte from the 
data register, the Lost Data bit is set if the CPU didn't read data in 
time, and the Read operation continues until the end of sector is 
reached.<BR>
At the end of the Read operation, the type of Data Address Mark 
encountered in the data field is recorded in the Status Register (bit 
5).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Write Sector<BR>
</B>Upon receipt of the command, the head is loaded, the busy status bit set 
and when an ID field is encountered that has the correct track number, 
correct sector number, correct side number, and correct CRC, a DRQ is 
generated.<BR>
The FD179X counts off 22 bytes (in double density) from the CRC field 
and the Write Gate output is made active if the DRQ is serviced (ie. the 
DR has been loaded by the computer). If DRQ has not been serviced, the 
command is terminated and the Lost Data status bit is set. If the DRQ 
has been serviced, 12 bytes of zeroes (in double density) are written to 
the disk, then the Data Address Mark as determined by the a0 field of 
the command.<BR>
The FD179X then writes the data field and generates DRQ's to the 
computer. If the DRQ is not serviced in time for continuous writing the 
Lost Data Status bit is set and a byte of zeroes is written on the disk 
and the command continues until the last byte of the sector is reached.<BR>
After the last data byte has been written on the disk, the two-byte CRC 
is computed internally and written on the disk followed by one byte of 
logic ones.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Type III commands<BR>
</B><BR>
<B>Read Address<BR>
</B>Upon receipt of the Read Address command, the head is loaded and the 
Busy Status bit is set. The next encountered ID field is then read in 
from the disk, and the six data bytes of the ID field are assembled and 
transferred to the DR, and a DRQ is generated for each byte. The six 
bytes of the ID field are : Track address, Side number, Sector address, 
Sector Length, CRC1, CRC2. Although the CRC bytes are transferred to the 
computer, the FD179X checks for validity and the CRC error status bit is 
set if there is a CRC error. The track address of the ID field is 
written into the sector register so that a comparison can be made by the 
user. At the end of the operation, an interrupt is generated and the 
Busy status bit is reset.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Read Track<BR>
</B>Upon receipt of the Read Track command, the head is loaded, and the busy 
status bit is set. Reading starts with the leading edge of the first 
encountered index pulse and continues until the next index pulse. All 
gap, header, and data bytes are assembled and transferred to the data 
register and DRQ's are generated for each byte. The accumulation of 
bytes is synchronized to each address mark encountered. An interrupt is 
generated at the completion of the command. The ID Address Mark, ID 
field, ID CRC bytes, DAM, Data and Data CRC bytes for each sector will 
be correct. The gap bytes may be read incorrectly during write-splice 
time because of synchronization.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Write Track (formatting a track)<BR>
</B>Upon receipt of the Write Track command, the head is loaded and the Busy 
Status bit is set. Writing starts with the leading edge of the first 
encountered index pulse and continues until the next index pulse, at 
which time the interrupt is activated. The Data Request is activated 
immediately upon receiving the command, but writing will not start until 
after the first byte has been loaded into the DR. If the DR has not been 
loaded by the time the index pulse is encountered, the operation is 
terminated making the device Not Busy, the Lost Data status bit is set, 
and the interrupt is activated. If a byte is not present in the DR when 
needed, a byte of zeroes is substituted. This sequence continues from 
one index mark to the next index mark. <BR>
Normally, whatever data pattern appears in the data register is written 
on the disk with a normal clock pattern. However, if the FD179X detects 
a data pattern of F5 thru FE in the data register, this is interpreted 
as data address marks with missing clocks or CRC generation. The CRC 
generator is initialized when an F5 data byte is about to be transferred 
(in MFM). An F7 pattern will generate two CRC bytes. As a consequence, 
the patterns F5 thru FE must not appear in the gaps, data fiels, or ID 
fiels. Tracks may be formatted with sector lengths of 128, 256, 512 or 
1024 bytes. See "Formatting" below for more info and example.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Type IV command (Force Interrupt)<BR>
</B>The Forced Interrupt command is generally used to terminate a multiple 
sector read or write command or insure Type I status register. This 
command can be loaded into the command register at any time. If there is 
a current command under execution (busy status bit set), the command 
will be terminated and the busy status bit reset.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Status Register<BR>
</B>Upon receipt of any command, except the Force Interrupt command, the 
Busy Status bit is set and the rest of the status bits are updated or 
cleared for the new command.<BR>
The user has the option of reading the status register through program 
control or using the DRQ line with DMA or interrupt methods. When the DR 
is read the DRQ bit in the Status register and the DRQ line are 
automatically reset. A write to the DR also causes both DRQ's to reset. 
The busy bit in the status may be monitored with a user program to 
determine when a command is complete, in lieu of using the INTRQ line. 
When using the INTRQ, a busy status check is not recommended because a 
read of the status register to determine the condition of busy will 
reset the INTRQ line.<BR>

<B>Status for type IV command<BR>
</B>If the Force Interrupt command is received while a command is under 
execution, the Busy status bit is reset and the rest of the status bits 
are unchanged.<BR>
If the Force Interrupt command is received when there is no command 
under execution, the Busy Status bit is reset and the rest of the status 
bits are updated or cleared. In this case, Status reflects the Type I 
commands.<BR>
<BR>
<B>External Circuit<BR>
</B>The floppy disk controller itself cannot select the drive number, side, 
disk density, and it cannot turn on/off the drive motor(s). These 
settings must be set up by an external circuit, which are (as far as 
they aren't set to a fixed setting) controlled through separate I/O 
addresses. For details have a look at the MSX FDC I/O addresses.<BR>
<BR>
Note that the FDC contains only one track register which is used for all 
drives. The current track position for each drive should be backed up in 
memory, and the track register should be updated each time when changing 
the current drive number.<BR>
<BR>
The external circuit might also use the INTRQ and DRQ lines to handle 
FDC operations by DMA transfers, and/or to produce interrupts upon 
completion. In the MSX these methods are not used, however, most MSX 
adapters allow to read out the state of INTRQ and DRQ from a custom I/O 
address (this isn't actually required because INTRQ is just a inverted 
copy of the Status Busy bit, and DRQ can be read out from the normal 
Status register either.<BR>

<B>Block 0 and 1<BR>
</B>These blocks are used by the clock, all values are stored in BCD format. 
Hours are counted from 0-23 when the 12/24 hour bit is set. Alternately 
hours could count from 0-11 (AM), and then from 20-31 (PM) when 12/24 
hour bit is cleared. In the MSX the 24 hour mode is used (and any 
conversions to 12 hour clocks are done by software).<BR>
The Year entry is 1980 based, ie. values 00-99 mean 1980-2079. The RTC 
expects a leap year when the lower two bits of the leap year counter are 
zero, as the MSX counts from 1980 onwards (which has been a leap year), 
the leap year counter should be initialized identical to the lower bits 
of the year counter.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Block 2 and 3<BR>
</B>These blocks may contain any custom data. The MSX2 BIOS them as follows: 
The scratch byte to detect the presence of the RTC chip, the other bytes 
in block 2 to set up the initial video mode settings, as well as the 
default cassette baud rate, key click, beep sound, etc. Block 3 may be 
used either to define the Title (displayed in boot screen, type=0), or 
the Password (verified in boot screen, type=1), or the BASIC Prompt 
(usually "Ok" ,type=2). Type 0 and 2 are stored as 6 character ascii 
string, type 1 is stored in form of a 16bit CRC together with an 
optional 'key cartridge value'.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Counter Registers (Port 84h, 85h, 86h)<BR>
</B>The 8253 includes three 16bit counters. In the MSX RS 232 interface 
counter 0 and 1 are internally used to generate the Baud rates for 
receiving and transmitting data, counter 2 may be used for whatever 
purposes (for example as timeout counter).<BR>
<BR>
The 8253 can operate at counting frequencies of up to 2MHz, in the MSX 
this might be 1.8432MHz, or 115.2kHz, or 28.8kHz (depending on the the 
Baud Fact value of Mode Setup byte (Port 81h). Counters are decremented 
at that frequency until they become zero, and are then automatically 
reloaded to the programmed reload value.<BR>
<BR>
For example, a Baud Rate of 19200bps can be generated by using a counter 
reload value of 0006h. Ie. 115200Hz / 6 = 19200Hz (assuming that Baud 
Fact has been set to 115.2kHz). Keep in mind that the counters 
Read/Write mode must have been configured before outputting the counters 
reload value (see Port 87h below).<BR>
<BR>
<B>8253 Mode Register (Port 87h, Write Only)<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>The 8253 is able to operate each counter in various modes, for the MSX 
RS232 interface Counter 0 and 1 (receive/transmit) should be set to mode 
3 (Square Wave), and Counter 2 (custom) should be set to mode 0. The six 
possible modes are:<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>Before reading or writing to a counter, the Read/Write mode must be 
initialized. In most cases Write Mode 3 should be selected, then output 
both the low byte and high byte of the desired counter reload value to 
Port 84h, 85h, or 86h (depending on whether counter 0, 1, or 2 should be 
initialized). The four possible Read/Write modes are:<BR>

<B>Opcode Timings<BR>
</B>Both MSX 1 and MSX 2 are using a Z80A CPU, operating at 3.579545MHz.<BR>
The execution time for each instruction is the number of clock cycles 
(specified in the instruction lists below) - plus the number of refresh 
cycles for that instruction.<BR>
<BR>
One refresh cycle is performed for each normal instruction. A total of 
two refresh cycles is performed for all instructions which include the 
following prefix byte(s): CB, ED, DD, FD, DDCB, or FDCB.<BR>
For example, a NOP instruction counts 4 cycles plus 1 refresh cycle, 
resulting in a execution time of 5 cycles, ie. 5/3579545 seconds.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupts<BR>
</B>Interrupts are supplied by the Video Display Controller (VDP) only. Note

<B>Normal 8bit and 16bit Registers<BR>
</B>The Accumulator (A) is the allround register for 8bit operations. 
Registers B, C, D, E, H, L are normal 8bit registers, which can be also 
accessed as 16bit register pairs BC, DE, HL.<BR>
The HL register pair is used as allround register for 16bit operations. 
B and BC are sometimes used as counters. DE is used as DEstination 
pointer in block transfer commands.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Second Register Set<BR>
</B>The Z80 includes a second register set (AF',BC',DE',HL') these 
registers cannot be accessed directly, but can be exchanged with the 
normal registers by using the EX AF,AF and EXX instructions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Refresh Register<BR>
</B>The lower 7 bits of the Refresh Register (R) are incremented with every 
instruction. Instructions with at least one prefix-byte (CB,DD,ED,FD, or 
DDCB,FDCB) will increment the register twice. Bit 7 can be used by 
programmer to store data. Permanent writing to this register will 
suppress memory refresh signals, causing Dynamic RAM to lose data.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupt Register<BR>
</B>The Interrupt Register (I) is used in interrupt mode 2 only (see command 
"im 2"). In other modes it can be used as simple 8bit data register.<BR>
<BR>
<B>IX and IY Registers<BR>
</B>IX and IY are able to manage almost all the things that HL is able to 
do. When used as memory pointers they are additionally including a 
signed index byte (IX+d). The disadvantage is that the opcodes occupy 
more memory bytes, and that they are less fast than HL-instructions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Undocumented 8bit Registers<BR>
</B>IXH, IXL, IYH, IYL are undocumented 8bit registers which can be used to 
access high and low bytes of the IX and IY registers (much like H and L 
for HL). Even though these registers do not officially exist, they seem 
to be available in all Z80 CPUs, and are quite commonly used by various 
software.<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Carry Flag (C)<BR>
</B>This flag signalizes if the result of an arithmetic operation exceeded 
the maximum range of 8 or 16 bits, ie. the flag is set if the result was 
less than Zero, or greater than 255 (8bit) or 65535 (16bit). After 
rotate/shift operations the bit that has been 'shifted out' is stored in 
the carry flag.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Zero Flag (Z)<BR>
</B>Signalizes if the result of an operation has been zero (Z) or not zero 
(NZ). Note that the flag is set (1) if the result was zero (0).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sign Flag (S)<BR>
</B>Signalizes if the result of an operation is negative (M) or positive 
(P), the sign flag is just a copy of the most significant bit of the 
result.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Parity/Overflow Flag (P/V)<BR>
</B>This flag is used as Parity Flag, or as Overflow Flag, or for other 
purposes, depending on the instruction.<BR>
Parity: Bit7 XOR Bit6 XOR Bit5 ... XOR Bit0 XOR 1.<BR>
8bit Overflow: Indicates if the result was greater/less than +127/-128.<BR>
HL Overflow: Indicates if the result was greater/less than +32767/-32768.<BR>
After LD A,I or LD A,R: Contains current state of IFF2.<BR>
After LDI,LDD,CPI,CPD,CPIR,CPDR: Set if BC&lt;&gt;0 at end of operation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>BCD Flags (H,N)<BR>
</B>These bits are solely supposed to be used by the DAA instruction. The N 
flag signalizes if the previous operation has be an addition or 
substraction. The H flag indicates if the lower 4 bits exceeded the 
range from 0-0Fh. (For 16bit instructions: H indicates if the lower 12 
bits exceeded the range from 0-0FFFh.)<BR>
After adding/subtracting two 8bit BCD values (0-99h) the DAA instruction 
can be used to convert the hexadecimal result in the A register (0-FFh) 
back to BCD format (0-99h). Note that DAA also requires the carry flag 
to be set correctly, and thus should not be used after INC A or DEC A.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Undocumented Flags (Bit 3,5)<BR>
</B>The content of these undocumented bits is by garbage by all instructions 
that affect one or more of the normal flags (for more info read the 
chapter Garbage in Flag Register), the only way to read out these flags 
would be to copy the flags register onto the stack by using the PUSH AF 
instruction.<BR>
However, the existence of these bits makes the AF register a full 16bit 
register, so that for example the code sequence PUSH DE, POP AF, PUSH 
AF, POP HL would set HL=DE with all 16bits intact.<BR>

</B>The following placeholders are used in the following chapters:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  r      8bit  register A,B,C,D,E,H,L
  rr     16bit register BC, DE, HL/IX/IY, AF/SP   (as described)
  i      8bit  register A,B,C,D,E,IXH/IYH,IXL/IYL
  ii     16bit register IX,IY
  n      8bit  immediate 00-FFh                   (unless described else)
  nn     16bit immediate 0000-FFFFh
  d      8bit  signed offset -128..+127
  f      flag  condition nz,z,nc,c AND/OR po,pe,p,m  (as described)
  (..)   16bit pointer to byte/word in memory
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Opcode Bytes<BR>
</B>Each command (including parameters) consists of 1-4 bytes. The 
respective bytes are described in the following chapters. In some cases 
the register number or other parameters are encoded into some bits of 
the opcode, in that case the opcode is specified as "xx". Opcode prefix 
bytes "DD" (IX) and "FD" (IY) are abbreviated as "pD".<BR>
<BR>
<B>Clock Cycles<BR>
</B>The clock cycle values in the following chapters specify the execution 
time of the instruction. For example, an 8-cycle instruction would take 
2 microseconds on a CPU which is operated at 4MHz (8/4 ms). For 
conditional instructions two values are specified, for example, 17;10 
means 17 cycles if condition true, and 10 cycles if false.<BR>
Note that in case that WAIT signals are sent to the CPU by the hardware 
then the execution may take longer.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Affected Flags<BR>
</B>The instruction tables below are including a six character wide field 
for the six flags: Sign, Zero, Halfcarry, Parity/Overflow, N-Flag, and 
Carry (in that order). The meaning of the separate characters is:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  s    Indicates Signed result
  z    Indicates Zero
  h    Indicates Halfcarry
  o    Indicates Overflow
  p    Indicates Parity
  c    Indicates Carry
  -    Flag is not affected
  0    Flag is cleared
  1    Flag is set
  x    Flag is destroyed (unspecified)
  i    State of IFF2
  e    Indicates BC&lt;&gt;0 for LDX(R) and CPX(R), or B=0 for INX(R) and OUTX(R)

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="z80interrupts"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;Z80 Interrupts</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Lack of Information<BR>
</B>Z80 interrupts are a mysterium, the official Z80 documentation basically 
denied the existence of interrupts in general. However, when describing 
opcodes such like IM 0, EI, and RETI the author couldn't fully avoid to 
mention the possibility that such a thing like interrupts might 
eventually exist by suggesting to refer to somewhat called an 
"application script about interrupt behaviour of Z80 systems".<BR>
<BR>
In case that this document really exists, then it is probably been 
horribly expensive, made available to authorized developers only, and 
not available nowadays anymore. The content of this document might or 
might not confirm the existence of interrupts, and/or explain other 
details?<BR>
<BR>
Judging from the fragments of information the leaked out in the Z80 
docs, the CPU supports non-maskable interrupts (NMI) and maskable 
interrupts (INT). MSX and CPC homecomputers aren't using NMIs, so 
information below is reverse engineered guesswork for systems that use 
maskable interrupts only.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupt Flip-Flop (IFF1,IFF2)<BR>
</B>These internal flags are used to enable/disable interrupts, in a raw INT 
based system which isn't using NMIs, it appears to be safe to treat 
these flags as a single IFF flag, instead separate IFF1 and IFF2.<BR>
<BR>
Interrupts can be enabled by the EI instruction (IFF=1) only, whereas 
the new IFF state isn't applied until the next instruction has completed 
(this ensures that an interrupt handler which is using the sequence "EI, 
RET" may return to the main program before the next interrupt is 
executed).<BR>
Interrupts can be disabled by the DI instruction (IFF=0), and are 
additionally automatically each time when an interrupt is executed.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupt Execution<BR>
</B>An interrupt is executed when an interrupt is requested by the hardware, 
and IFF is set. Whenever both conditions are true, the interrupt is 
executed after the completion of the current opcode.<BR>
Note that repeated block commands (such like LDIR) can be interrupted 
also, the interrupt return address on the stack then points to the 
interrupted opcode, so that the instruction may continue as normal once 
the interrupt handler returns.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Interrupt Modes (IM 0,1,2)<BR>
</B>The Z80 supports three interrupts modes which can be selected by IM 0, 
IM 1, and IM 2 instructions. The table below describes the respective 
operation and execution time upon interrupt execution in each mode.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Mode  Cycles  Refresh  Operation
  0     1+var   0+var    IFF=0, read and execute opcode from databus
  1     12      1        IFF=0, CALL 0038h
  2     18      1        IFF=0, CALL (I*100h+databus)
</TD></TR></TABLE>Mode 0 requires an opcode to be output to the databus by external 
hardware, in case that no byte is output, and provided that the 'empty' 
databus is free of garbage, then the CPU might tend to read a value of 
FFh (opcode RST 38h) - the clock cycles, refresh cycles, and executed 
operation are then fully identical as in Mode 1.<BR>
Mode 1 interrupts always perform a CALL 0038h operation. The downside is 
that many systems may have ROM located at this address, making it 
impossible to hook the interrupt handler directly.<BR>
<BR>
Mode 2 calls to a 16bit address which is read from a table in memory, 
the table pointer is calculated from the "I" register (initialized by LD 
I,A instruction) multiplied by 100h, plus an index byte which is read 
from the databus. The following trick may be used to gain stable results 
in Mode 2 even if no index byte is supplied on the databus: For example, 
set I=40h the origin of the table will be then at 4000h on memory. Now 
fill the entire area from 4000h to 4100h (101h bytes, including 4100h) 
by the value 41h. The CPU will then perform a CALL 4141h upon interrupt 
execution - regardless of whether the randomized index byte is a even or 
odd number.<BR>
<BR>
<B>RETI and RETN<BR>
</B>These instructions are somewhat supposed to return from maskable and 
non-maskable interrupts. In a raw INT based system which isn't using 
NMIs they appear to behave 100% identical to normal RET instructions.<BR>

<B>Mirrored Instructions<BR>
</B>NEG  (ED44) is mirrored to ED4C,54,5C,64,6C,74,7C.<BR>
RETN (ED45) is mirrored to ED55,65,75.<BR>
RETI (ED4D) is mirrored to ED5D,6D,7D.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mirrored IM Instructions<BR>
</B>IM 0,X,1,2 (ED46,4E,56,5E) are mirrored to ED66,6E,76,7E.<BR>
Whereas IM X is an undocumented mirrored instruction itself which 
appears to be identical to either IM 0 or IM 1 instruction (?).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Duplicated LD HL Instructions<BR>
</B>LD (nn),HL (opcode 22NNNN) is mirrored to ED63NNNN.<BR>
LD HL,(nn) (opcode 2ANNNN) is mirrored to ED6BNNNN.<BR>
Unlike the other instructions in this chapter, these two opcodes are 
officially documented. The clock/refresh cycles for the mirrored 
instructions are then 20/2 instead of 16/1 as for the native 8080 
instructions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mirrored BIT N,(ii+d) Instructions<BR>
</B>Unlike as for RES and SET, the BIT instruction does not support a third 
operand, ie. DD or FD prefixes cannot be used on a BIT N,r instruction 
in order to produce a BIT r,N,(ii+d) instruction. When attempting this, 
the 'r' operand is ignored, and the resulting instruction is identical 
to BIT N,(ii+d).<BR>
Except that, not tested yet, maybe undocumented flags are then read from 
'r' instead of from ii+d(?).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Non-Functional Opcodes<BR>
</B>The following opcodes behave much like the NOP instruction.<BR>
ED00-3F, ED77, ED7F, ED80-9F, EDA4-A7, EDAC-AF, EDB4-B7, EDBC-BF, EDC0-FF.<BR>
The execution time for these opcodes is 8 clock cycles, 2 refresh cycles.<BR>
Note that some of these opcodes appear to be used for additional 
instructions by the R800 CPU in newer turbo R models.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ignored DD and FD Prefixes<BR>
</B>In some cases, DD-prefixes (IX) and FD-prefixes (IY) may be ignored by 
the CPU. This happens when using one (or more) of the above prefixes 
prior to instructions that already contain an ED, DD, or FD prefix, or 
prior to any instructions that do not support IX, IY, IXL, IXH, IYL, IYH 
operands. In such cases, 4 clock cycles and 1 refresh cycle are counted 
for each ignored prefix byte.<BR>

<B>Nocash Z80-flags description</B><BR>
This chapter describes the undocumented Z80 flags (bit 3 and 5 of the 
Flags Register), these flags are affected by ALL instructions that 
modify one or more of the normal flags - all OTHER instructions do NOT 
affect the undocumented flags.<BR>
<BR>
For some instructions, the content of some flags has been officially 
documented as 'destroyed', indicating that the flags contain garbage, 
the exact garbage calculation for these instructions will be described 
here also.<BR>
<BR>
All information below just for curiosity. Keep in mind that Z80 
compatible CPUs (or emulators) may not supply identical results, so that 
it wouldn't be a good idea to use these flags in any programs (not that 
they could be very useful anyways).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Normal Behaviour for Undocumented Flags<BR>
</B>In most cases, undocumented flags are copied from the Bit 3 and Bit 5 of 
the result byte. That is "A AND 28h" for:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  RLD; CPL; RLCA; RLA; LD A,I; ADD OP; ADC OP; XOR OP; AND OP;
  RRD; NEG; RRCA; RRA; LD A,R; SUB OP; SBC OP; OR OP ; DAA.
</TD></TR></TABLE>When other operands than A may be modified, "OP AND 28h" for:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  RLC OP; RL OP; SLA OP; SLL OP; INC OP; IN OP,(C);
  RRC OP; RR OP; SRA OP; SRL OP; DEC OP
</TD></TR></TABLE>For 16bit instructions flags are calculated as "RR AND 2800h":<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  ADD RR,XX; ADC RR,XX; SBC RR,XX.
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Slightly Special Undocumented Flags<BR>
</B>For 'CP OP' flags are calculated as "OP AND 28h", that is the unmodified 
operand, and NOT the internally calculated result of the comparision.<BR>
For 'SCF' and 'CCF' flags are calculated as "(A OR F) AND 28h", ie. the 
flags remain set if they have been set before.<BR>
For 'BIT N,R' flags are calculated as "OP AND 28h", additionally the 
P-Flag is set to the same value than the Z-Flag (ie. the Parity of "OP 
AND MASK"), and the S-flag is set to "OP AND MASK AND 80h".<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fatal MEMPTR Undocumented Flags<BR>
</B>For 'BIT N,(HL)' the P- and S-flags are set as for BIT N,R, but the 
undocumented flags are calculated as "MEMPTR AND 2800h", for more info 
about MEMPTR read on below.<BR>
The same applies to 'BIT N,(ii+d)', but the result is less unpredictable 
because the instruction sets MEMPTR=ii+d, so that undocumented flags are 
"&lt;ii+d&gt; AND 2800h".<BR>
<BR>
<B>Memory Block Command Undocumented Flags<BR>
</B>For LDI, LDD, LDIR, LDDR, undocumented flags are "((A+DATA) AND 08h) + 
((A+DATA) AND 02h)*10h".<BR>
For CPI, CPD, CPIR, CPDR, undocumented flags are "((A-DATA-FLG_H) AND 
08h) + ((A-DATA-FLG_H) AND 02h)*10h", whereas the CPU first calculates 
A-DATA, and then internally subtracts the resulting H-flag from the 
result.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Chaotic I/O Block Command Flags<BR>
</B>The INI, IND, INIR, INDR, OUTI, OUTD, OTIR, OTDR instructions are doing 
a lot of obscure things, to simplify the description a placeholder 
called DUMMY is used in the formulas.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  DUMMY = "REG_C+DATA+1"    ;for INI/INIR
  DUMMY = "REG_C+DATA-1"    ;for IND/INDR
  DUMMY = "REG_L+DATA"      ;for OUTI,OUTD,OTIR,OTDR
  FLG_C = Carry  of above "DUMMY" calculation
  FLG_H = Carry  of above "DUMMY" calculation (same as FLG_C)
  FLG_N = Sign   of "DATA"
  FLG_P = Parity of "REG_B XOR (DUMMY AND 07h)"
  FLG_S = Sign   of "REG_B"
  UNDOC = Bit3,5 of "REG_B AND 28h"
</TD></TR></TABLE>The above registers L and B are meant to contain the new values which 
are already incremented/decremented by the instruction.<BR>
Note that the official docs mis-described the N-Flag as set, and the 
C-Flag as not affected.<BR>
<BR>
<B>DAA Flags<BR>
</B>Addition (if N was 0):<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  FLG_H = (OLD_A AND 0Fh) &gt; 09h
  FLG_C = Carry of result
</TD></TR></TABLE>Subtraction (if N was 1):<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  FLG_H = (NEW_A AND 0Fh) &gt; 09h
  FLG_C = OLD_CARRY OR (OLD_A&gt;99h)
</TD></TR></TABLE>For both addition and subtraction, N remains unmodified, and S, Z, P 
contain "Sign", Zero, and Parity of result (A). Undocumented flags are 
set as (A AND 28h) as normal.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mis-documented Flags<BR>
</B>For all XOR/OR: H=N=C=0, and for all AND: H=1, N=C=0, unlike described 
else in Z80 docs. Also note C,N flag description bug for I/O block 
commands (see above).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Internal MEMPTR Register<BR>
</B>This is an internal Z80 register, modified by some instructions, and 
usually completely hidden to the user, except that Bit 11 and Bit 13 can 
be read out at a later time by BIT N,(HL) instructions.<BR>
The following list specifies the resulting content of the MEMPTR 
register caused by the respective instructions.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Content Instruction

  rr      EX (SP),rr              ;rr=HL,IX,IY (MEMPTR=new value of rr)
  rr+1    ADD/ADC/SBC rr,xx       ;rr=HL,IX,IY (MEMPTR=old value of rr+1)

<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  OUT (N),A and block commands LDXX, CPXX, INXX, OUTXX
  and probably interrupts in IM 0, 1, 2
</TD></TR></TABLE>All other commands do not affect the MEMPTR register - this includes all 
instructions with operand (HL), all PUSH and POP instructions, not 
executed conditionals JR f,d, DJNZ d, RET f (ie. with with 
condition=false), and the JP HL/IX/IY jump instructions.<BR>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><A NAME="z80compatibility"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;Z80 Compatibility</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
The Z80 CPU is (almost) fully backwards compatible to older 8080 and 
8085 CPUs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Instruction Format<BR>
</B>The Z80 syntax simplifies the chaotic 8080/8085 syntax. For example, Z80 
uses the command "LD" for all load instructions, 8080/8085 used various 
different commands depending on whether the operands are 8bit registers, 
16bit registers, memory pointers, and/or an immediates. However, these 
changes apply to the source code only - the generated binary code is 
identical for both CPUs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Parity/Overflow Flag<BR>
</B>The Z80 CPU uses Bit 2 of the flag register as Overflow flag for 
arithmetic instructions, and as Parity flag for other instructions. 
8080/8085 CPUs are always using this bit as Parity flag for both 
arithmetic and non-arithmetic instructions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Z80 Specific Instructions<BR>
</B>The following instructions are available for Z80 CPUs only, but not for 
older 8080/8085 CPUs:<BR>
All CB-prefixed opcodes (most Shift/Rotate, all BIT/SET/RES commands).<BR>
All ED-prefixed opcodes (various instructions, and all block commands).<BR>
All DD/FD-prefixed opcodes (registers IX and IY).<BR>
As well as DJNZ nn; JR nn; JR f,nn; EX AF,AF; and EXX.<BR>
<BR>
<B>8085 Specific Instructions<BR>
</B>The 8085 instruction set set includes two specific opcodes in addition 
to the 8080 instruction set, used to control 8085-specifc interrupts and 
SID and SOD input/output signals. These opcodes, RIM (20h) and SIM 
(30h), are not supported by Z80 instruction set.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Z80 vs Z80A<BR>
</B>Both Z80 and Z80A are including the same instruction set, the only 
difference is the supported clock frequency (Z80 = max 2.5MHz, Z80A = 
max 4MHz).<BR>
<BR>

MSX Disk Images (.DSK files) are just a raw copy of the data of all 
sectors from a real disk. The DSK format does not contain any 
information about the physical format of the disk, and thus doesn't 
support uncommon 'copy protected' formats.<BR>
<BR>
Usually a disk image contains data for 80 tracks, 9 sectors (sized 200h 
bytes each, and numbered from 01h to 09h). Resulting in an image size of 
360Kbytes or 720KBytes, depending on whether the disk is single sided, 
or double sided.<BR>
<BR>
However, most MSX disks include basic information in their boot sectors, 
which could be used (if it does exist, and if it is filled out 
correctly) to determine the number of heads, sectors, and tracks of the 
disk.<BR>

programs which are saved on tapes.<BR>
Note that Basic programs could be also saved (and loaded) in Ascii 
format.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ascii/Text Files<BR>
</B>Ascii files are saved as raw data without any header. Lines are usually 
ended by CR,LF (0Dh,0Ah) characters. A clean Ascii file should be 
terminated by an EOF (1Ah) character.<BR>
<BR>
<B>COM Files<BR>
</B>CP/M and MSXDOS programs are saved as .COM files, these files do not 
have any headers, the load- and startaddress is always 100h. Because of 
the CP/M filesystem, the filesize of CP/M files must be a multiple of 
80h.<BR>

Each MSX file consists of two blocks: a header block, and a data block. 
(Except for ascii files, which may have multiple data blocks - but only 
one header block).<BR>
All data is saved without any checksums, readfails could be particulary 
recognized by verifying that each byte has proper Start- and Stopbits. 
The baud rate can be determined by measuring the length of the 
synchronization bits of each block.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Format of MSX Header Blocks<BR>
</B><TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  1E00h  "1"-bits  synchronisation bits
     10  bytes     file type (repeated 10 times the same value)
      6  bytes     file name (unused entries filled by SPCs)
</TD></TR></TABLE>The file-type could be binary (D0h), basic (D3h), or ascii (EAh).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Format of MSX Basic Data Blocks (Type D3h)<BR>
</B><TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>   780h  "1"-bits  synchronisation bits
   &lt;nn&gt;  lines     data, format for each line as follows:
                         2  bytes   origin of next line (lower byte first)
                      &lt;xx&gt;  bytes   data (xx = nextlineorg-currentlineorg-2)
      2  bytes     0000h zero origin, no further lines following
    7-8  bytes     terminator, seven or eight 00h bytes
</TD></TR></TABLE>Note: The first line is assumed to begin at origin 8001h.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Format of Bits and Bytes<BR>
</B>The MSX BIOS generates start and stop bits for each byte:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  1  start bit ("0")
  8  data bits (lower bit first)
  1  first stop bit ("1")
  1  second stop bit ("1") (but might be unreadable if short delay follows)
</TD></TR></TABLE>And finally, the MSX bits themselves are encoded as follows:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  "0"  =   \_______/"""""""\
  "1"  =   \___/"""\___/"""\
</TD></TR></TABLE>Physically the signal looks less square, rather like a sine-wave.<BR>
(Note: The signal could be inverted, ie. high-pulse first...)<BR>

The first 16 bytes of each Cartridge or Expansion ROM are used as 
header. In most cases (ie. in game cartridges) only the first two 
entries are used, and the remaing entries are set to zero.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>  Address Name       Expl.
  X000    ID         Identification Code (4241h=ROM Cartridge, 4443h=SUBROM)
  X002    INIT       Start Address (could be anywhere 0000-BFFF)
  X004    Statement  Statement expansion routine address. For creating new
                     CALL statement (For example CALL MUSIC used in FM PAC)
  X006    DEV        For creating new devices (CAS:, MEM:, GRP:, etc...)
  X008    TEXT       Pointer to BASIC program in ROM, must be in 8000-BFFF.
  X00A-F  N/A        Reserved (0)
</TD></TR></TABLE>Upon startup the BIOS scans all SLOTs for Cartridge ROMs (ID 4241h) at 
addresses 4000h and 8000h, and for SUBROMs (ID 4443h) at address 0000h.<BR>
Most Cartridge ROMs occupy the area from 4000h-BFFFh, but might be also 
using (or being mirrored to) the whole address space from 0000h to 
FFFFh.<BR>
